<h2>What Is Feather</h2>
<p>
  Feather is a fully open source widget-based web framework created in javascript.  Feather does depend on some other technologies to be able to provide all its features.  It uses jQuery, CouchDB, NodeJS, and jQueryUI along with a few others.</p> 
<p>
  I was first introduced to feather in early 2012, and since being introduced I have become completely excited about digging deeper into its functionality.  Feather can be used to build a secure and fully featured website with client/server communication, database access, and a nice framework for organizing your code.  The site your looking at is built on feather, and while my skills at being a web developer are still pretty limited since I mainly come from a C++/Embedded background it has really helped me gain a better understanding of web development.
</p>
<p>
  This website is going to being in flux as feather is still in early development, and we hope that others will join in to help develop features in feather.  My main goal is to have a nice helpful place to post my own learnings while using feather, and hopefully gain interest from other developers that like where feather is going.
